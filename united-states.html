                        Greek style architecture has certainly permeated the Western World and influenced many architects as well as
                        private designers. Thomas Jefferson was one such person who took a major interest in the styles of the 
                        Ancient Greeks, in fact, it wasn't just the architecture that piqued his interest. Thomas Jefferson's 
                        interest in the Ancient Greeks spanned the totality of their culture, so much so that he even spoke the 
                        language. Due to his large amount of interest in the Greeks Jefferson built his own house, Monticello with Greek styles
                        in mind. Of course, Monticello was not the only building which took on the influence of the Greeks in the
                        United States, Jefferson was also one of the many people responsible for adapting the federal style of architecture which was used
                        in the construction of a multitude of government buildings such as the White House and the Capitol building.
