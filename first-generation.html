                        The first generation Firebird had characteristic Coke bottle styling shared with its cousin, the Chevrolet Camaro. 
                        Announcing a Pontiac styling trend, the Firebird's bumpers were integrated into the design of the front end, 
                        giving it a more streamlined look than the Camaro. The Firebird's rear "slit" taillights were inspired by the 
                        1966–1967 Pontiac GTO. Both a two-door hardtop and a convertible were offered through the 1969 model year. 
                        Originally, the car was a "consolation prize" for Pontiac, which had desired to produce a two-seat sports car 
                        based on its original Banshee concept car. However, GM feared this would cut into Chevrolet Corvette sales, and 
                        gave Pontiac a piece of the "pony car" market through sharing the F-body platform with Chevrolet.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 1967 base model Firebird came equipped with the Pontiac 230 cu in (3.8 L) SOHC inline-six. Based on the 
                        architecture of the standard Chevrolet 230 cu in (3.8 L) inline-six, it was fitted with a one-barrel carburetor 
                        and rated at 165 hp (123 kW).[1] The "Sprint" model six came with a four-barrel carburetor, developing 215 hp 
                        (160 kW).[6] Most buyers opted for one of three V8s: the 326 cu in (5.3 L) with a two-barrel carburetor producing 
                        250 hp (186 kW); the four-barrel "HO" (high output) 326, producing 285 hp (213 kW); or the 325 hp (242 kW) 400 cu 
                        in (6.6 L) from the GTO. All 1967–1968 400 CI engines had throttle restrictors that blocked the carburetors' 
                        secondaries from fully opening.[1] A "Ram Air" option was also available, providing functional hood scoops, higher 
                        flow heads with stronger valve springs, and a hotter camshaft. Power for the Ram Air package was the same as the 
                        conventional 400 HO, but peaked at 5,200 rpm.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 230 cu in (3.8 L) engines were subsequently enlarged for 1968 to 250 cubic inches(4.1 liters), the base 
                        version developing an increased 175 hp (130 kW) using a one-barrel carburetor, and the high-output Sprint version 
                        the same 215 hp with a four-barrel carburetor. Also for the 1968 model, the 326 cu in (5.3 L) engine was replaced 
                        by the Pontiac 350 cu in (5.7 L) V8, which actually displaced 354 cu in (5.8 L), and produced 265 hp (198 kW) with 
                        a two-barrel carburetor. An HO version of the 350 cu in (5.7 L) with a revised cam was also offered starting in 
                        that year, which developed 320 hp (239 kW). Power output of the other engines was increased marginally.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There was an additional Ram Air IV option for the 400 cu in (6.6 L) V8 engines during 1969, complementing the 
                        Ram Air 400(now often colloquially but incorrectly called the "Ram Air III," a name never used by Pontiac). 
                        The Ram Air IV was rated at 345 hp (350 PS; 257 kW) at 5000 rpm and 430 lb⋅ft (583 N⋅m) of torque at 3400 rpm;[7] 
                        and 335 hp (340 PS; 250 kW) respectively. The 350 cu in (5.7 L) HO engine was revised again with a different cam 
                        and cylinder heads resulting in 325 hp (242 kW). During 1969 a special 303 cu in (5.0 L) engine was designed for 
                        SCCA road racing applications that was not available in production cars.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The styling difference from the 1967 to the 1968 model was the addition of federally-mandated side marker lights: 
                        for the front of the car, the turn signals were made larger and extended to wrap around the front edges of the 
                        car, and on the rear, the Pontiac (V-shaped) Arrowhead logo was added to each side. The front door vent-windows 
                        were replaced with a single pane of glass and Astro Ventilation, a fresh-air-inlet system. The 1969 model received 
                        a major facelift with a new front-end design but unlike the GTO, it did not have the Endura bumper. The instrument 
                        panel and steering wheel were revised. The ignition switch was moved from the dashboard to the steering column 
                        with the introduction of GM's new locking ignition switch/steering wheel.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In March 1969, a US$1,083 ($7,643 in 2020 [9])[10] optional handling package called the "Trans Am performance 
                        and appearance package", UPC "WS4", named after the Trans Am Series, was introduced. A total of 689 hardtops 
                        and eight convertibles were made.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to engineering problems that delayed the introduction of the new 1970 Firebird beyond the usual fall 
                        debut, Pontiac continued production of 1969 model Firebirds into the early months of the 1970 model year 
                        (the other 1970 Pontiac models had been introduced on September 18, 1969). By late spring of 1969, Pontiac 
                        had deleted all model-year references on Firebird literature and promotional materials, anticipating the extended 
                        production run of the then-current 1969 models.<br>
