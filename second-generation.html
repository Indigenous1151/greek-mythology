                        The second-generation debut for the 1970 model year was delayed until February 26, 1970, because 
                        of tooling and engineering problems; thus, its popular designation as a 1970½ model, while leftover 
                        1969s were listed in early Pontiac literature without a model-year identification. This generation of 
                        Firebirds were available in coupe form only; after the 1969 model year, convertibles were not available until 
                        1989.<br>

                    <p>
                        Replacing the "Coke bottle" styling was a more "swoopy" body style, while still retaining some traditional 
                        elements. The top of the rear window line going almost straight down to the lip of the trunk lid, a look 
                        that was to epitomize F-body styling for the longest period during the Firebird's lifetime. The new design 
                        was initially characterized by a large B-pillar, until 1975 when the rear window was enlarged.<br>

                        <p>
                            The first year of the second generation Firebird began offering a wider array of model subtypes, 
                            and marked the appearance of the Firebird Esprit, and the Firebird Formula. The Firebird Esprit was 
                            offered as a luxury model that came with appearance options, the deluxe interior package and a Pontiac 
                            350 as standard equipment. The Formula was advertised as a cost-effective alternative to the Trans Am, 
                            and could be ordered with all the options available to the Trans Am with the exception being the fender 
                            flares, shaker scoop and fender heat extractors.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The base model Firebird came equipped with a 155 hp (116 kW) 250 cu in (4.1 L) inline-six. The Firebird 
                            Esprit and the Firebird Formula came standard with the 255 hp (190 kW) 350 cu in (5.7 L). The Esprit could 
                            be upgraded to a two barrel carbureted 400 cu in (6.6 L)265 hp (198 kW), while the Formula could be optioned 
                            to receive the L78 4 barrel 400 that produced 330 hp (250 kW) or the L74 Ram Air III 400 345 hp (257 kW).<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There were two Ram Air 400 cu in (6.6 L) engines available for the 1970 Trans Am: the 335 hp (250 kW) L74 Ram 
                            Air III 400 (366 hp (273 kW) in the GTO) and the 345 hp (257 kW) L67 Ram Air IV (370 hp (280 kW) in the GTO) 
                            that were carried over from 1969. The Ram Air IV was exclusive to the Trans Am, and could not be ordered on 
                            any of the lower Firebird models. The difference between the GTO and Firebird engines was that the secondary 
                            carburetor's throttle linkage had a restrictor which prevented the rear barrels from opening completely, 
                            adjusting the linkage could allow full carburetor operation resulting in identical engine performance.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the 1970 and 1971 model years, all Firebirds equipped with radios had the antennae mounted "in-glass" in the windshield.

                            The 1971 model year had a few minor changes to the Firebird. Fenders across all models now featured a one 
                            year only exhaust vent seen on the lower half of the fenders. The interior options also changed to the newer 
                            style collared bucket seats in the deluxe interior, and the previous year's seats with the headrest where no 
                            longer available. The rear seat console was introduced as an option, and Honeycomb wheels became available for 
                            all Firebirds.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1971 saw changes to the way the engines were rated from factory. GM mandated that engines no longer use SAE 
                            Gross horsepower ratings and to use the SAE Net power ratings to help alleviate the rising cost of insurance 
                            for performance vehicles. The compression ration was also lowered for some of the models, de-tuning the power 
                            rating for some of the motors as part of new requirements for low-leaded fuels, however, the engine options 
                            remained mostly unchanged from 1970. As the limit for the compression ratio was lowered, this allowed for larger 
                            displacement motors to become available. The 455 was now available for the Firebird in two configurations. The 
                            455 engine was available in the L75 325 hp (242 kW) version and the LS5 335 hp (250 kW) HO version. Both the 455 
                            and 455 HO were available as engine options for the Firebird Formula, but the Trans Am received the 455 HO as 
                            standard equipment.

                        <p>
                            During a 1972 strike, the Firebird (and the similar F-body Camaro) were nearly dropped.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1972 saw very few significant changes to the model year. One discernible difference that can be used to 
                            differentiate a 1972 Firebird from the other 1970-73 Firebirds is the hexagonal honeycomb grille insert 
                            on the nose of the vehicle.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Engine options remained mostly unchained again, however, the L75 455 engine was dropped, but the LS5 
                            455 HO remained available as an option for the Formula and standard for the Trans Am. Pontiac had apparently 
                            advertised the 1972 455 HO motor as de-tuned to 300hp to appease concerns about insurance costs for higher 
                            output performance vehicles, but the motor was unchanged from 1971.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Starting in 1972, and continuing until 1977, the Firebird was only produced at the Norwood, Ohio, facility.

                        <p>
                            In 1973, the Trans Am added two new colors to the line-up, Buccaneer Red and Brewster Green. Other exterior 
                            upgrades included the updated more modern nose bird. The new, soon to be iconic, hood bird was option “RPO WW7 
                            Hood Decal”, a $55 option exclusive to Trans Am. The “Trans Am” decals were a bit larger than previous versions, 
                            and shared the same accent color schemes as the hood bird.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Inside the 1973, Firebird the standard interior equipment was almost the same as prior years. The new 
                            “Horse Collar” optional custom interior featured new seat coverings and door panels. The custom interior 
                            is well liked by the public as sporty and luxurious. The 1973 Firebird also had to meet the new safety and 
                            emissions requirements for 1973. There was now extra steel reinforcements in the bumper and core support 
                            to fender.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1973 Trans Am engine displaced 455 cubic inches, the base L75 and Super Duty LS2 option. The base 
                            455 produced 40 fewer horsepower than the round port Super Duty 455. Horsepower for the base L75 455 
                            was rated at 250@4000 rpm and 370 lb/ft @2800 rpm. Pontiac removed the H.O. designation from the base engine, 
                            and simply decaled the now non-functioning shaker with “455”.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The “all hand assembled” LS2 SD455 engine was rated at 290@4000 rpm and 395 lb/ft @3600 rpm. All Pontiac 
                            motors now had to be fitted with new EGR system, which delayed the SD-455 program until late into production 
                            year. The shaker decal on the scoop read "SD-455".<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1973 Trans Am introduced "Radial Tuned Suspension". When ordered, it included 15” radial tires. Radial 
                            Tuned Suspension with radial tires delivered a much more comfortable ride, while providing a better cornering 
                            grip.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1973 Trans Am production was up over previous years, the L75 455 production was 3130 Automatics and 
                            1420 Manuals. The special ordered $550 Option LS2 SD-455 production saw 180 automatics and 72 manuals.

                            Curb weights rose dramatically in the 1974 model year because of the implementation of 5 mph (8.0 km/h) 
                            telescoping bumpers and various other crash- and safety-related structural enhancements; SD455 Trans 
                            Ams weighed in at 3,850 lb (1,746 kg) in their first year of production 
                            (1974 model year; actually 1973).<br>

                            The 1974 models featured a redesigned "shovel-nose" front end and new wide "slotted" taillights. The 
                            400, 455, and SD-455 engines were offered in the Trans Am and Formula models during 1974. A June

                            Drag Illustrated. With an unmodified car and a test weight of 4,010 lbs the testers clocked 14.25 
                            seconds at 101 mph. The car had an automatic and A/C.[27] Also, the factory rating of 290 hp was listed 
                            at 4,400 rpm while the factory tachometer has a 5,750 rpm redline. A production line stock 1974 SD455 
                            produced 253 rear wheel HP on a chassis dyno, as reported by High Performance Pontiac magazine (January 2007). 
                            This is also consistent with the 290 SAE net horsepower factory rating (as measured at the crankshaft).<br>

                            A 1974 Firebird was driven by Jim Rockford in the pilot movie and the first season (1974–1975) of The 
                            Rockford Files; every following season, Rockford would change to the next model year. However, in the 
                            sixth season (1979–1980), Rockford continued to drive the 1978 Firebird from season five, as the star, 
                            James Garner, disliked the 1979 model's restyled front end. The cars in the show were badged as lower-tier 
                            Esprit models but were Formulas with the twin-scoop hood replaced with a scoopless one. Another hint was 
                            the twin exhausts and rear anti-roll bars that were not used on the Esprit.

                        <p>
                            The 1975 models featured a new wraparound rear window that curved out to occupy more of the B-Pillar, 
                            but the rear body shape and bumper remained unchanged. The turn signals were moved up from the valance 
                            panel to the grills which helped distinguish the 1975 from the 1974 front end as they are relatively 
                            similar. This was also the last year of the larger profile larger snout Formula hood for the Firebird 
                            Formula.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Super Duty engine and TurboHydramatic 400 3-speed automatic were no longer available in 1975. 
                            Due to the use of catalytic converters starting in 1975, the TH400 would not fit alongside the 
                            catalytic converter underneath the vehicle. The smaller TurboHydramatic 350 automatic was deemed 
                            suitable as the power output for the motors had significantly decreased from the earlier years. TH350 
                            drew less power from the motor, and also did not require an electronic kickdown system. The Pontiac 
                            L78 400 was standard in the Trans Am and the 455 was optional for both 1975 and 1976 models.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1975 also saw the start of the "500577" cast 400 engine blocks enter production. The 500577 cast 
                            blocks were considered a weaker cast, as the motors had a weaker nickel content and had metal 
                            shaved off in the lower journals of the motor to decrease the overall weight, cost and emissions 
                            from the motor in an attempt to appease the tightening smog restrictions. These blocks became the 
                            norm up until the W72 motor reverted to the original specifications from the start of the decade 
                            with the 481988 cast in late 1977.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Originally, the L75 455 7.5L V8 was dropped entirely, but public demand saw the 455 return mid-year, 
                            available only with a 4-speed Borg Warner Super T-10, and it was no longer available for the Formula. 
                            Although it was brought back as the "455 H.O", it was not the same motor as the 1971-72 LS2 455 HO seen 
                            in the earlier Firebirds. The motor was a standard D-port engine with a very low profile camshaft and 
                            restrictive exhaust system that was also seen in the larger body Pontiac platforms. The power output was
                            restricted to 200HP with a torque rating of 330lb⋅ft at 2000rpm. This resulted in a very critical response 
                            to the "HO" moniker being used on a station wagon motor by critics at the time. However, when later contrasted 
                            to what other performance vehicles were available on the market, it was the largest displacement "performance" 
                            motor still available that could easily produce more power with basic modifications. Track testing in 1975 
                            showed the 455 received a 16.12 second quarter mile time, which was on par with the only other competition, 
                            the L82 Corvette.

                            Pontiac celebrated its 50th anniversary year in 1976. To commemorate this event, Pontiac unveiled a 
                            special Trans Am option at the 1976 Chicago Auto Show. Painted in black with gold accents, this was 
                            the first "anniversary" Trans Am package and the first production black and gold special edition. A 
                            removable T-top developed by Hurst was set to be included on all Y82 LE T/As, but proved problematic 
                            in installation and quality control, leading some Y82s to not be delivered with the Hurst T-top roof. 
                            All Hurst T-top equipped cars were built at the Norwood, Ohio, factory. It became an available option 
                            for other Firebirds in 1977.<br>
                        </p>

                            1976 marked the end of the Pontiac L75 7.5 liter 455 V8, as it could no longer meet the tightening 
                            emissions restrictions and the "HO" moniker used the year prior was dropped. The L75 was only available 
                            with a four-speed manual Borg Warner Super T-10, and was exclusive to the Trans Am.<br>

                            1976 also introduced the "W50 appearance package" for the Formula model line, consisting of a two-tone 
                            appearance package with lower accents across the bottom of the body, a large "Formula" decal across the 
                            bottom of each door, and a "Firebird" decal on the rear spoiler.<br>

                            The Firebird received it's most recognizable front end for the 1977 model year. The shaker scoop was 
                            also revised for this year, with the early 1977-built T/As coming with off-center, lower-profile shaker 
                            scoops. The Formula hood was changed for the last time for the second generation with a much lower profile. 
                            The snowflake wheel became an option for all Firebirds and was standard with the Y82 appearance package, 
                            although it could be replaced with Rally II wheels as a credit option.<br>

                            For the Esprit, an optional appearance package RPO W60 called the "Skybird appearance package" became 
                            available, featuring an all blue exterior and interior. This package was originally slated to be called 
                            the "Bluebird" similar to the "Yellowbird" and "Redbird" packages to follow in the upcoming model years, 
                            but the name was already in use for a company that produced school buses.<br>

                            In 1977, General Motors began to source a larger selection of V8 motors to supply in the lower model 
                            Firebirds, and the Oldsmobile 350 V8 as well as the Chevrolet 350 V8 became options for the Firebird, 
                            Esprit, and Formula. This was the first time GM had required Pontiac to source another V8 motor to supply 
                            in its Firebird model line, as previously, the Chevrolet inline six was the only other outsourced motor 
                            seen in a Firebird. This marked the beginning of the end for Pontiac's engine development.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Trans Am had now three different engine options to chose from, the standard Pontiac L78 400, the 
                            optional extra cost Pontiac W72 400, and the Oldsmobile-sourced L80 403. 1977 also saw the cubic inch 
                            metrics on the shaker dropped in favour of the displacement of the cylinders. The shakers now wore the 
                            decal "6.6 Litre" for all L78 Pontiac 400 and L80 Oldsmobile 403 motors. Only the optional W72 Pontiac 
                            400 received the "T/A 6.6" decal. Many reproduction decal kits for Firebirds often did not include the 
                            "6.6 Litre" decal, which is why many Firebirds today bear the incorrect decal on the shaker.<br>

                            As Pontiac had lost the 455 in the previous model year, they offered a modified 400 Pontiac V8 dubbed 
                            the "T/A 6.6" RPO W72 with a single four-barrel 800CFM Rochester Quadrajet carburettor rated at 200 bhp 
                            (203 PS; 149 kW) at 3,600 rpm and a maximum torque of 325 lb⋅ft (441 N⋅m) at 2,400 rpm, as opposed to the 
                            regular 6.6 Litre 400 (RPO L78) rated at 180 hp (134 kW). The T/A 6.6 equipped engines had chrome valve 
                            covers, while the base 400 engines had painted valve covers. For 1977, the W72 shared the same air cleaner 
                            and shared the same 500577 cast block as the L78, but received the 6x4 heads, whereas the L78 only received 
                            the 6x8 heads. The 6x4 heads were used on early Pontiac 350 blocks that helped increase the compression, 
                            and also had hardened valve seats for a higher RPM operating range.<br>

                            The Oldsmobile 403 was implemented as the 400 Pontiac could not satisfy emissions requirements for 
                            high-altitude states and California. Wanting to still offer a 6.6 litre option for the Trans Am, the 403 
                            Olds was seen as a suitable replacement as when equipped with an A.I.R emissions system, it could satisfy 
                            the emissions criteria for these states and still offer the power the Trans Am was known for. The L80 
                            Oldsmobile had slightly more power than the standard L78 Pontiac 400 at 185hp (138kW) and offered the same 
                            low end torque of 320 lb⋅ft (430 N⋅m) at a more useable operating range of 2,200rpm.<br>

                            From 1977 to 1981, the Firebird used four square headlamps, while the Camaro continued to retain the two 
                            round headlights that had been shared by both second-generation designs. The 1977 Trans-Am special edition 
                            became famous after being featured in Smokey and the Bandit. The 1980 turbo model was used for Smokey and 
                            the Bandit II.

                            Changes for 1978 were slight, with a switch from a honeycomb to a crosshatch pattern grille being the most 
                            notable change to the body style. The decals for the standard Trans Ams changed from the "looping style" 
                            lettering to the "block-style" font that would remain on the Firebird until the end of the second generation. 
                            T-tops in 1978 transitioned from Hurst units to Fisher (GM) in mid-year. Pontiac also introduced the Red Bird 
                            package on the Firebird Esprit model. Painted in Roman red with a matching deluxe red interior, it 
                            demonstrated gold accents with a unique Red Bird graphic on the b-pillars. It also included a Formula 
                            steering wheel with gold spokes and gold dash bezel, similar to the ones included in Special Edition package, 
                            however, the red and gold steering wheel was exclusive to the Red Bird Esprit.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The W72 engine option also saw a revision to the camshaft duration and the tuning of the Rochester Quadrajet 
                            which lead to a 10% increase of horsepower from the following year, bringing the total to 220hp. 
                            Additionally, the earlier stronger and more durable 481988 cast block returned on the W72, denoted with a 
                            large "XX" cast protruding off side of the block near the cast code. The WS6 special performance package 
                            developed by Herb Adams was introduced as a handling option for the Trans Am, including a larger diameter 
                            rear sway bar, tighter ratio steering box, 15x8 snowflake wheels, additional frame bracing, as well as 
                            other suspension changes. Delays in manufacturing prevented the rear disc brake (RPO J65) from being 
                            available on the 1978 model year. Approximately 25% of Trans Ams in 1978 had the WS6 option according 
                            to Pontiac sales information at the start of 1979. At the end of 1978, the WS6 handling package became 
                            available for the Formula models as well.

                            The front end was restyled for 1979, which also marked the 10th anniversary of the Trans Am. For 1979, 
                            there were three possible engine options. The L80 Oldsmobile 403ci motor became the standard motor and 
                            was only available with the TH350 3-speed automatic. The W72 was available for a short period and in limited 
                            supply. This was the last of the line for the Pontiac large displacement V8 engines, and only available with
                            the Borg Warner Super T-10, also requiring the WS6 handling package as mandatory equipment in conjunction 
                            with this driveline choice. As an alternative option for customers who wanted a four-speed transmission, the 
                            smaller displacement Pontiac L37 301 4.9 liter V8 was offered as a credit option and could come equipped with 
                            either the ST-10 or TH350.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A limited-edition anniversary package was made available: platinum silver paint with charcoal gray upper 
                            paint accents and mirrored T-tops, and a special interior featuring silver leather seats with custom-embroidered 
                            Firebird emblems and aircraft-inspired red lighting for the gauges. The 10th-anniversary cars also featured 
                            special 10th-anniversary decals, including a Firebird hood decal that extended off of the hood and onto the 
                            front fenders. Pontiac produced 7,500 10th anniversary cars, of which 1,817 were equipped with the high-output 
                            Pontiac T/A 6.6 W72 400 engine. Two 10th anniversary Trans Ams were the actual pace cars for the 1979 Daytona 
                            500, which has been called the race that made NASCAR. Car and Driver magazine named the Trans Am with the WS6 
                            performance package the best handling car of 1979. During period dyno testing, the National Hot Rod Association 
                            rated the limited-availability T/A 6.6 high-output Pontiac 400 engine at 260–280 net horsepower, which was 
                            significantly higher than Pontiac's conservative rating of 220 hp. In 1979 Pontiac sold 116,535 Trans Ams, 
                            the highest sold in a year.

                            In 1980, ever-increasing emissions restrictions led Pontiac to drop all of its large-displacement engines. 
                            1980 therefore saw the biggest engine changes for the Trans Am. The 301, offered in 1979 as a credit option,
                            was now the standard engine. No manual transmission was available for the Formula or Trans Am in 1980, 
                            all received the 3-speed automatic Turbo Hydramatic 350. Engine options included a turbocharged 301 or 
                            the Chevrolet 305 small block. The turbocharged 301 used a Garrett TB305 turbo attached to a single Rochester 
                            Quadrajet four-barrel carburettor and featured a hood mounted "boost" gauge that would light up as the 
                            TB305 accumulated boost. The hood of the 301T equipped Firebirds had a large offset bulge to accommodate 
                            for the mounting position of the carburettor on the motor as the turbocharger exhaust occupied a large 
                            amount of space in the engine bay. The 301T set up was relatively primitive new technology at the time of 
                            its development and could not properly maximise the efficiency of the turbocharged set-up. The 301T equipped 
                            T/A's were restricted to an automatic transmission and a 3.08 rear differential ratio, but were seen as a 
                            disappointment contrasted to the venerable W72 400 available just a year prior. Some owners have claimed 
                            quite reasonable performance numbers with the modern fuels.<br>

                            A 1980 turbo Trans Am was featured in the movie Smokey and the Bandit II, but was fitted with nitrous 
                            oxide tanks by Marvin Miller Systems to get the desired performance.

                            1981 became the final year for the second generation Pontiac Firebird. The three engine options were 
                            unchanged for the model line-up, however, the option for a four-speed Borg Warner Super T-10 was 
                            re-introduced for the Formula and Trans Am, but was only available with the Chevrolet sourced LG4 305 
                            5.0 liter V8. As with all other General Motors vehicles for 1981, all engines came equipped with the 
                            "computer command control" system attached to the carburettor. <br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The hood decal for the 1981 model year was also slightly restyled. All Firebirds also received an 
                            embossed silver Firebird decal on the petrol tank cap attached to the rear taillights. On the special 
                            edition Trans Ams, this Firebird was gold.<br>

                            The G80 limited slip differential that was previously standard for the last decade on all Trans Ams 
                            became a pay-extra option. This decision was made by Pontiac to prepare dealers for the new ordering 
                            and pricing for the third generation Firebird where the G80 was no longer being included as a standard 
                            option for the Trans Am.
