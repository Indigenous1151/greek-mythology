                        The availability and cost of gasoline (two fuel crises had occurred by this time) meant the weight 
                        and the fuel consumption of the third generation had to be considered in the design. In F-body 
                        development, both the third generation Firebird and Camaro were proposed as possible front-wheel-drive 
                        platforms, but the idea was scrapped. Computerized engine management was in its infancy, and with fuel 
                        efficiency being the primary objective, it was not possible to have high horsepower and torque numbers. 
                        They did manage to cut enough weight from the design so that acceleration performance would be better 
                        than the 1981 models. They also succeeded in reducing fuel consumption, offering a four-cylinder Firebird 
                        that would provide 34 miles per US gallon (6.9 l/100 km). GM executives decided that engineering effort 
                        would best be spent on aerodynamics and chassis development. They created a modern platform so that when 
                        engine technology advanced, they would have a well-balanced package with acceleration, braking, handling, 
                        and aerodynamics.<br>

                        The Firebird and Camaro were completely redesigned for the 1982 model year, with the windshield slope 
                        set at 62 degrees, (about three degrees steeper than anything GM had ever tried before), and for the 
                        first time, a large, glass-dominated hatchback that required no metal structure to support it. Two concealed 
                        pop-up headlights, a first on the F-Body cars, were the primary characteristic that distinguished the third 
                        generation Firebird from both its Camaro sibling and its prior form (a styling characteristic carried into 
                        the fourth generation's design). In addition to being about 500 pounds (230 kg) lighter than the previous 
                        design, the new design was the most aerodynamic product GM had ever released. Wind tunnels were used to form 
                        the new F-Body platform's shape, and Pontiac took full advantage of it. The aerodynamic developments extended 
                        to the finned aluminum wheels with smooth hubcaps and a functional rear spoiler.

                        <p>
                            In 1988 the Trans Am GTA, which was built with the standard 350 cu in 5.7 L V8 engine, was 
                            offered with the option of removable roof "T-tops". However, any buyer ordering this option 
                            could only order the 305 cu in 5.0 L V8 engine, because the roof did not have the support for 
                            all the extra torque from the engine, requiring a power trade-off for those who wanted this option. 
                            Pontiac also introduced a rare option for the Trans Am GTA in the 1988 model year, the $800 
                            "notchback", which replaced the standard long large, glass-dominated hatchback to make the Firebird 
                            design look less like the Camaro design, and shared an appearance with the Pontiac Fiero. The 
                            notchback was a special fiberglass rear deck lid, replacing the long-sloped window with a short 
                            vertical rear window, resembling the back of a Ferrari 288 GTO.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Approximately 700 of these notchbacks were built in 1988 and offered for sale by Pontiac. The 
                            promotion was only in the form of a sheet in the back of a notebook of available options. The 
                            notchbacks were made by Auto-Fab of Auburn Hills, Michigan. Problems with the incorrect fitting 
                            of the notchbacks to the GTAs at the Van Nuys plant often resulted in delays of several months for 
                            buyers who wanted this option. Furthermore, quality control problems plagued the notchback, many 
                            owners complained of rippling and deforming of the fiberglass rear deck, and others complained of 
                            large defects resembling acne forming in the notchbacks. Pontiac had to repair them under warranty, 
                            sanding down the imperfections, and repainting them, only to have more flaws resurface months later. 
                            Because of the poor quality and numerous expensive warranty repairs and repainting, the notchback was 
                            subsequently canceled for the 1989 model year, via a bulletin in August 1988, although production 
                            records indicate that a few were produced.
