                        The British Museum is a beacon for the Ancient Greek styles of architecture, boasting a multitude of colonnades, 
                        entablatures, and pediments. A great many buildings throughout the UK use the same style as the British Museum,
                        a style called Greek Revivial which was peaking in popularity in the 1820's when architect Sir Robert Smirke (1780-1867)
                        designed the museum. The Greek Revivial style is denoted by the use of a low pitch roof, triangular pediment and columns.

                    <p style="text-indent: 1rem">
                        The Canada House is another building which was built in the Greek Revival style around the same 
                        time as the British Museum and also by the same architect. The Grange is another example of a building built in the
                        Greek Revival style that was originally built to be lived in but altered over the course of time. Currently, The Grange,
                        which is located in Northington is used as an opera house, though it very well could have been demolished in the 1970's
                        if not for the public outcry it caused.
