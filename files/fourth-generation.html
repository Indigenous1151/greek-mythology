                    <p>
                        The fourth-generation Firebird amplified the aerodynamic styling initiated by the previous 
                        generation. While the live rear axle and floorpan aft of the front seats remained largely the 
                        same, ninety percent of the Firebird's parts were all-new. Overall, the styling of the Firebird 
                        more strongly reflected the Banshee IV concept car than the 1991 "facelift" did. As with the Camaro, 
                        major improvements included standard dual airbags, four-wheel anti-lock brakes, 16-inch wheels, 
                        rack-and-pinion power steering, short/long-arm front suspension, and several non-rusting composite 
                        body panels. Throughout its fourth generation, trim levels included V6-powered Firebird, and V8-powered 
                        Formula and Trans Am. Standard manual transmissions were the T5 five-speed manual for the V6s, Borg-Warner′s 
                        T56 six-speed manual for the V8s. The 4L60 four-speed automatic was optional for both in 1993, becoming the 
                        4L60E with built-in electronic controls in 1994.
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="1993-1997">1993-1997</h2>
                        <p>
                            From 1993 until 1995 (1995 non-California cars), Firebirds received a 160 hp (119 kW) 3.4 L V6, 
                            an enhanced version of the third-generation's 3.1 L V6. Beginning mid-year 1995 onward, a Series 
                            II 3.8 L V6 with 200 hp (149 kW) became the Firebird's sole engine. From 1993 to 1997, the sole 
                            engine for the Formula and Trans Am was the 5.7 L LT1 V8, essentially identical to the LT1 in the 
                            C4 Corvette except for more flow-restrictive intake and exhaust systems. Steering wheel audio controls 
                            were included with optional uplevel cassette or compact disc stereo systems.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beginning with 1994 model year cars, "Delco 2001"-series stereo systems replaced the previous Delco 
                            units. This revised series, also introduced for other Pontiac car lines, featured ergonomically-designed 
                            control panels with larger buttons and an optional seven-band graphic equalizer. Also in 1994, the 
                            fourth-generation convertible was available; every Firebird (and Camaro) convertible featured a glass 
                            rear window with a built-in electric defroster.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The 1995 models were the same as those of previous years, but traction control (ASR: acceleration 
                            slip regulation) was available for LT1 Firebirds, controlled by a switch on the console. The steering 
                            wheels in all Firebirds were also changed; their optional built-in audio controls were more closely
                            grouped on each side. The "Trans Am GT" trim level was dropped from the lineup after its model year 
                            run in 1994. For 1995, all Trans Ams received 155-mph speedometers and Z-rated tires. 1995 was also 
                            the first year of the vented version of the Opti-Spark distributors on LT1 F-cars, addressing a common 
                            mechanical fault with the unit. The 'transmission perform' button was available only in the 1994 and 
                            1995 Formula and Trans Am. This option was stopped for the 1996 and later models, but the unused 
                            connections remain available for 1996 and 1997 Formula and Trans Am. While 1995 cars still used the 
                            OBD-I (on-board diagnostic) computer system (the last year of any American car including the F-body 
                            to use OBD-I), a majority of them had OBD-II connector ports under the dash.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Firebird performance levels improved for 1996, with the establishment of the stronger 200-hp 3.8 L 
                            V6 as the new base engine, and the power rating of the LT1 increased to 285 for 1996, due to its 
                            new dual catalytic-converter exhaust system. 1996 was also the first model year of the OBD-II computer 
                            system. Optional performance enhancements were available for each Firebird trim level; the Y87 
                            performance packages for V6s added mechanical features of the V8 setups, such as four-wheel disc brakes, 
                            faster-response steering, limited-slip rear differential, and dual tailpipes. For Formulas and Trans Ams, 
                            functional dual-inlet "Ram Air" hoods returned as part of the WS6 performance package. The optional 
                            package boosted rated horsepower from 285 to 305, and torque from 325 lb·ft to 335. Also included were 
                            17x9-wheels wheels with 275/40ZR17 tires, suspension improvements, oval dual tailpipe tips, and a WS6 
                            badge. Bilstein shocks were a further option with the package.<br>

                        <p>
                            The 1997 model year introduced standard air conditioning, daytime running lamps (utilizing the front 
                            turn signal lamps), digital odometer and optional 500-watt Monsoon cassette or compact disc stereo 
                            systems to all Firebird trim levels. For V6 Firebirds, a W68 sport appearance package was also introduced 
                            as a counterpart to the Camaro RS trim level. The WS6 "Ram Air" performance package was now also an option 
                            for the Formula and Trans Am convertibles, although these convertibles did not receive the 17-inch 
                            wheel-and-tire combination. There were 41 Formula convertibles and 463 Trans Am convertibles produced 
                            from 1996 to 1997 with the WS6 package.

                        <p>
                            In 1997, in relation to the Camaro, the Firebird received a mid-cycle refresh for the 1998 model 
                            year. Major changes included a new hood and front fascia with dual intakes, retracting quad halogen 
                            headlights, circular turn signals and fog lamps, a front license plate pocket, lower fender air vents, 
                            unified-style lower door raised lettering for each trim level, and a new "honeycomb" rear light panel, 
                            with circular reverse lamps. In the dashboard, "next-generation" reduced-force dual airbags became 
                            standard. As before, the Formula and Trans Am again received a close derivative of the Corvette's 5.7 
                            L V8, the LS1 of the C5 Corvette, as the LT1 (and LT4) V8s were discontinued. The LS1 Firebirds were 
                            also equipped with an aluminum driveshaft, replacing the previous steel version, while all Firebird trim 
                            levels gained four-wheel disc brakes with dual-piston front calipers and larger rotors at each wheel, 
                            complete with a solenoid-based Bosch anti-lock system. The Formula convertible was no longer offered.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Beginning in 1998 for 1999 models, a standard 16.8-gallon non-metallic fuel tank increased the 
                            potential traveling range. GM's ASR traction control system was extended to the V6-powered Firebirds, 
                            and all LS1 (V8) and Y87 (V6) Firebirds also received a Zexel/Torsen II slip-reduction rear axle. An 
                            electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) system replaced the old hydraulic proportioning valve for 
                            improved brake performance. An enhanced sensing and diagnostic module (SDM) recorded vehicle speed, 
                            engine rpm, throttle position, and brake use in the last five seconds prior to airbag deployment. In 
                            1999, a Hurst shifter for variants with the 6-speed manual and a power steering cooler became options 
                            for LS1 Firebirds.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In 2000, the WS6 performance package was available exclusively for the 2001 model year Trans Am coupe 
                            and convertible variants.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For 2002, more convenience items such as power mirrors and power antenna became standard equipment, 
                            while cassette stereos were phased out.

                        <p>
                            The special-edition extra-performance Firehawk (available in Formula trim for 1993–1997, and again in 
                            both Formula and Trans Am trims for 1999–2002) was produced by SLP Engineering, Inc., and sold through 
                            Pontiac dealerships. Featuring 17-inch wheels with namesake Firestone Firehawk 275/40ZR17 tires along 
                            with a functional twin-inlet hood above a specific air cleaner box, its rated power increased to 300 hp 
                            (224 kW) and 330 lb·ft (445 Nm) of torque. A total of 201 Firehawks were built for 1993. In 1994, the 
                            Firehawk package was expanded to include options for a suspension upgrade as well as a larger-diameter 
                            exhaust system that could boost power to 315 hp (235 kW). T-top Formula coupes and convertibles could 
                            also be optioned as Firehawks beginning in 1995. For 1996 and 1997, the Firehawk gained rectangular 
                            driving lights mounted inside the front scoops and (except Firehawk convertibles) the Trans Am's elevated 
                            rear wing. In 1997, an LT4 Firehawk was also available, utilizing the same 330 hp (246 kW), 
                            balanced-and-blueprinted LT4 V8 engine as found in the manual-transmission 1996 Corvette. A total of 
                            29 LT4-powered Firehawks were produced.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Power levels for the 1999 Firehawk, powered by the LS1 V8, rose to 327 hp (244 kW) (330 in 2000, 335 in 
                            2001, and 345 in late 2002 models equipped with the "Blackwing" intake). A 10th-anniversary Firehawk 
                            was available in 2001, distinguished as a black Trans Am coupe (123 units) and convertible (16 units) 
                            with gold-painted hood stripes (prototype only), gold vinyl stripes on hood and spoiler (production), 
                            gold 17-inch wheels, and gold tailpipe tips.

                        <p>
                            In 1994 only, a "Trans Am GT" option was available. Trans Am GTs did not receive any special badging, 
                            graphics, or emblems, and looked externally identical to the base Trans Am cars. The GT package 
                            included 245/50ZR16 tires and a 155-mph speedometer. Non-GT optioned Trans Ams in 1994 received 
                            235/55R16 tires, a 115-mph speedometer, and a much lower top-speed limiter. The "highrise spoiler", 
                            leather, and T-tops were not standard on the Trans Am GT cars in 1994, nor any year of LT1 Trans Am. 
                            RPO code T43 "uplevel spoiler" was an option on all Trans Ams, and while the mass majority of 1994 
                            Trans Am GT cars received the T43 spoiler (along with the majority of all 1993–1997 Trans Ams), it 
                            was not part of the Trans Am GT package. Both base Trans Ams and Trans am GTs could be ordered as coupe, 
                            T-top, or convertible versions and were both available with automatic or manual transmissions. While the 
                            GT package was a cost option on the 1994 Trans Am, a majority of 1994 Trans Ams were made with the GT 
                            package.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All of the 1994 Trans Am GT options became standard in 1995–2002 as part of the Trans Am package, and 
                            the GT name/package was dropped for 1995. Some of the early fourth-generation Trans Am and Formula 
                            Firebirds list "GT" on the vehicle's title or registration. The reason behind this is because the VIN 
                            does not specify a "package" (Formula, Trans Am, Trans Am GT, Firehawk, etc.); it only specifies the 
                            engine (5.7 L V8 LT1). Because the title is based on the VIN alone, titles and registrations often list 
                            all of the packages, but it does not mean the car is equipped with any certain package.

                            The 1994 model year marked the 25th anniversary of the Trans Am, and another anniversary edition was 
                            released, painted white with a single dark blue stripe down the center of the vehicle that was 
                            reminiscent of the 1970 Trans Am. It also featured white-painted, five-spoke, 16-inch alloy wheels, 
                            and white leather seats and door trim. This edition was available in either coupe or convertible form.

                            2001 was the 75th anniversary of Pontiac. A 75th anniversary package incorporated a power and performance 
                            package that included power door locks including retained accessory power, power windows including express

                            50-state low emission vehicle. There were a total of 472 of these packages sold in 2001, No. 239 on the 
                            L36 Firebird, 231 on the Formula W66 coupe, 5 on Formula Firehawks, and 2 on Trans-Ams. The manufacturer 
                            original window stickers included this as a separate package listing the items and one price.
