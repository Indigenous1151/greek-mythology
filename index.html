                            Greek mythology has carried it's influence far and wide throughout the Western world, the ways 
                        in which this influence has been spread vary greatly, one such way is through architecture. There 
                        are a couple key aspects to the architectural stlye of the ancient greeks, most notably is 
                        the column. The column is the most prevalent and noticable architectural design that was created
                        by the Greeks, its use can be seen all over the world, especially in government buildings.<br/>

                            Connected with the column is the colonnade, simply a sequence of columns all connected together 
                        by an entablature. For clarification, an entablature is a horizontal continuous support comprised 
                        of three layers, the architrave, frieze and cornice ordered from bottom to top. entablatures are 
                        usually found on classical buildings and are supported by columns or walls.<br/>

                            Another important feature created by the Greeks is the pediment. Pediments are typically 
                        triangular in shape and are located above the entablature of classical buildings. Within the 
                        entablature you can find another of the important architectural features provided by the ancient 
                        greeks, the frieze. The frieze as mentioned before is the middle layer of the entablature, it is 
                        denoted by the artistic designs which are carved into them.<br/>
